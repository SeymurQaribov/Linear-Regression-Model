Overview

This GitHub project demonstrates the process of building a Linear Regression model using insurance data. Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for predictive modeling, and it can be valuable in predicting numerical outcomes based on input features. In this project, we will explore, preprocess, and analyze the insurance dataset to build a linear regression model that can predict insurance costs based on various factors.

Dataset

The insurance dataset used in this project contains information about different individuals and their corresponding insurance charges. It includes the following columns:

Age: The age of the insured person.

Sex: The gender of the insured person (male/female).

BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.

Children: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.

Smoker: A binary value indicating whether the insured is a smoker (yes/no).

Region: The region of the United States where the insured resides.

Charges: The insurance charges billed to the insured.

The dataset is provided in a CSV file and will be used for training and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
